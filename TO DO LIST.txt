*** = Not important.
+- = Medium important.
!!! = Very important.

Yet to be taken:
-(!!!) Add progress in the game such as unlocking newcharacters or stats increasing as the level increases.
-(+-) Create the list of needed sounds for Osher (partially done).
-(***) Edit the sprite sheets for objects.

Nadav:
-(!!!) Think of a way to replace all the switch in the program.

Ely:
-(+-) Add levels loader to menu.
-(***) Add more stats like defense (complicated), attack, attack speed.
-(+-) Add unmmovable objects (obstacles).

Gal:
-(***) Split updateBoard (too crowded).
-(!!!) Remove target struct and replace with
       shared_ptr of Character.
-(!!!) Class projectile (visuals of skills).

Stuff to figure out:
-(!!!) Think of a generic way to add new levels.
-(+-) Think of how to balance the progress in the game.
-(***) Make sure the enemies don't spawn on each other.

List for Osher:
- Background music for menu.
- Background music for different levels (like 3 levels).
- Click sounds - click on buttons, click on characters.
- Hover buttons sound.
- Skills sounds (Gal).
- Collision sound.

Bugs:
