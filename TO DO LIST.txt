*** = Not important.
+- = Medium important.
!!! = Very important.

Yet to be taken:
-(!!!) Add progress in the game such as unlocking new characters or stats increasing as the level increases.
-(+-) Create the list of needed sounds for Osher (partially done).
-(***) Edit the sprite sheets for objects.

Nadav:

Ely:
-(+-) Add levels loader to menu.
-(+-) Add unmmovable objects (obstacles).

Gal:
-(***) Split updateBoard (too crowded).
-(!!!) Class projectile (visuals of skills).

Stuff to figure out:
-(+-) Think of how to balance the progress in the game.
-(***) Make sure the enemies don't spawn on each other.

List for Osher:
- Background music for menu.
- Background music for different levels (like 3 levels).
- Click sounds - click on buttons, click on characters.
- Hover buttons sound.
- Skills sounds (Gal).
- Collision sound.
- Human roar sound (warrior shouting)

Bugs:
